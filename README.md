<h2>Thanks for checking out my first batch script! ðŸ¦¨</h2>

This was specifically made to organize any art you receive, whether it's **fanart, commissions, or NSFW art.** The Batch script will simply ask for the name of your character, and create your parent folder (name of your character), and three child folders (Fanart, Commissions, NSFW).

> [!NOTE]
> The batch script will create the character folder in the same directory the script is in, so I highly recommend creating a parent folder to store all of your character art and putting the batch script in there!

<h2>Brief instructions</h2>
